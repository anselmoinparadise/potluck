# Problem/Solution

This project is discerning two pairs of problem/solution statements:

**Problem 1:** Online courses have low completion rates. 

**Solution 1:** Connect online course modules directly to active project workflows, so the user only completes courses as needed.

And,

**Problem 2:** The dynamic of high aggression \(whether passive or active\) and low empathy defines our political discourse, making it difficult for people to maintain focus and deliver solutions.

**Solution 2:** Gamify the process of reflective listening on video conference using the Empathy Cafe model.

The idea is to on ramp early adopters with an MVP focused on Empathy Cafe. If a core group of users love it, continue to build features into a productivity/MOOC platform. 

Potluck re-tools distributed grassroots organizing models with reflective listening, a simple and accessible way of engaging the empathy process in our brains and bodies. 

In most conversations we use active listening-- when you are speaking, I am patiently and quietly listening to what you're saying. When it's my turn to speak, you'd return the favor. Reflective Listening adds one step. As you listen, you reflect back, paraphrase, describe the meaning and feeling of what the speaker conveyed to you. This small change makes a big impact in a number of ways, boosting learning, concentration, and the all-alluring love hormone, oxytocin. 

Reflective listening is already successful in healthcare, education and business. Political movements already apply active listening every day, why not add the simple step? 

As you navigate this project description, please consider supporting Potluck. Let's develop and test experiences that gamify the reflective listening process for any kind of work or learning. Thank you for your time and consideration.
