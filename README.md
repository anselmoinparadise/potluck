# Welcome

Potluck re-tools distributed grassroots organizing models with reflective listening, a simple and accessible way of engaging the empathy process in our brains and bodies. 

In most conversations we use active listening-- when you are speaking, I am patiently and quietly listening. When I speak, you'd return the favor. Reflective Listening adds one step. As you listen, you reflect back, paraphrase, describe the meaning and feeling of what the speaker conveyed to you. This small change makes a big impact in a number of ways, boosting learning, concentration, and the all-alluring love hormone, oxytocin. 

Reflective listening is already successful in healthcare, education and business. Political movements already apply active listening every day, why not add the simple step? 

As you navigate this project description, please consider supporting Potluck. Let's develop and test experiences that gamify the reflective listening process for any kind of work or learning. Thank you for your time and consideration.
