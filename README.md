# Welcome

Potluck is a workflow environment for grassroots political change. This project is about changing our world in clear steps, enabling the user to experience proof-driven family in action.

Political science is constantly evolving with more transparent, healthy and effective ways to engage our democracy. But when systems prove to work well, it's hard to replicate them. Potluck is about making it easier to openly distribute electoral and advocacy systems for specific campaigns and situations.

There is a bottleneck of experience and trust between the career professionals who run our political system, and members of the general public. When a new volunteer walks in the door of a congressional campaign, it is difficult to verify their experience level or trust their personal judgment. This is why Potluck aims for **a model of distributed organizing based on knowledge proofs, a proof attached to each specific gig**, thereby increasing one's speed and ability to move between political efforts and earn permissions for specialized roles.
