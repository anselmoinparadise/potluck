# Building Tables

When users want to start a project, they build a table. Tables are static pages where one can drag and drop elements into organized experiences. A good table inspires people to participate and offers clear opportunities to cook chomps together.

Users may copy user-generated templates of tables.

Any changes to a table registers a new version. Users with permission can view, comment and depending on permissions structure, vote on version changes.
