# Cooking Chomps

When bringing the food we made to a potluck with friends and family, it doesn't matter if you followed a recipe that has been done thousands of times. You still brought something to the table that nobody else planned to bring. The chomp is the basic unit of participation in Potluck.

Chomp cards present a work interface to type or edit text, make calls, send email blasts, take votes on version changes, canvass turf cutting, data input, etc. 

Training prompts in the form of charm cards can be presented with chomps, and once completed would issue the first Confirmation for access. 

When users follow a chomp, it is added to their chomp list. Users can navigate chomps on table pages or by going to their overall chomp list and sorting.

Chomps with due dates or numerical goals have an activity and urgency gauge themed with Heat. Chomps ahead of schedule are hot, ones that fall behind go cold. It is important to set goals realistically so chomps stay hot, or nice and warm. Depending on the configuration of tables, scripts can automatically recommend chomps based on the table's needs and user's preferences.

Chomps that link together in sequence are stacks. Access and administration of chomps can be organized at the stack level.  

Chomps that don't attract interest go cold often and might get dropped in favor of more engaging workflows.
