**User Story: Rosa the Treasurer**

**A group of parents decided to help a retired teacher run for their local school board. Rosa volunteered to be Treasurer for the campaign.** 

**She creates a new, "table" for the campaign based on an existing template called California School Board Candidates 2020. This template already includes detailed sequences of tasks or, "chomps" for finance-related work. Every state and federal campaign finance filing is dated according to deadline with clear steps to complete them.**

**Rosa follows the tutorial and passes a quizlet for the Form 460 chomp, thereby earning her first, "charm" for the Form 460 chomp. From now on, any time she completes this chomp, she can opt to attach proof of work to her charm.** 

**Rosa continues to earn a positive reputation as a volunteer treasurer. Anyone can verify her proofs of work and knowledge by reading her charms. Now instead of being dedicated to one candidate, she likes to help other treasurers in her spare time. Potluck sends regular notifications of finance-related chomps from teachers running for school board throughout the state.** 

**User Story: United Way of Boulder**

**Last election cycle, the United Way of Boulder organized a successful local ballot initiative for affordable housing bonds. Winning with 71% of the vote, United Wayâ€™s coalition partners throughout Colorado are eager to run local initiatives in the coming election cycle. Because the Boulder teams used Potluck, they are easily able to share their system statewide.**

**Aurora Families for Housing is a coalition of community groups, churches and labor. They are able to copy, paste and modify the Boulder model according to local needs. As more cities setup bond campaigns, Aurora agrees to share data on how effective different voter/member contact messages are, in addition to data on volunteer engagement with particular chomps. This collaboration promotes a statewide ecosystem where organizers can quickly design, test and share campaign systems based on value.**
