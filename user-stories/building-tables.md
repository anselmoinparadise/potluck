# Building Tables

When users want to start a project, they build a table. Tables are static pages where one can drag and drop elements into organized experiences. A good table inspires people to participate and offers clear opportunities to cook chomps together.

Instead of prescribing a particular workflow experience like Kanban boards, tables allow for users to organize work in their own ways. Users may copy user-generated templates of tables.

Any changes to a table registers a new version. Users with permission can view, comment and depending on permissions structure, vote on version changes.

Because permissions are rooted through charms, the creation of a new table will automatically set permissions for the table creator\(s\) by assigning certain charms. If there's a sole creator, one might receive a, "Benevolent Dictator" charm. This charm gives them full administrative power to manage content and user interaction with the table. If the table is founded by a committee of people, all founders may be assigned equal voting rights, like a non-profit board, at table creation. Tables can remain lead by their founding structure such as Benevolent Dictator, or use version changes to transition to other leadership structures.
