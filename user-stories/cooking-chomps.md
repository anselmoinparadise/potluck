# Cooking Chomps

When bringing food to a potluck with friends and family, it doesn't matter if you followed a recipe that has been done thousands of times. You made that meal in a way that was unique of everyone there. The chomp is the basic unit of participation in Potluck.

Chomps present a work interface to type or edit text, make calls, send email blasts, take votes on version changes, canvass turf cutting, data input, etc. 

Training prompts can be presented with chomps, and once completed would issue charms for initial access. 

Every time you complete a chomp, you retain a copy of your contributions. Like archiving an email, this proof of work becomes a charm and it's information can be kept private or shared.

When users follow a chomp, it is added to their chomp list. Users can navigate chomps on table pages or by going to their overall chomp list and sorting.

Chomps with due dates or numerical goals have an activity and urgency gauge themed with Heat. Chomps ahead of schedule are hot, ones that fall behind go cold. It is important to set goals realistically so chomps stay hot, or nice and warm. Depending on the configuration of tables, scripts can automatically recommend chomps based on the table's needs and user's preferences.

Users could set table preferences through chomp interactions. When joining a table, the user could be presented with a questionnaire about how they want to participate in the table. Based on the answers they enter in the chomp, the table script \(or other users reviewing the answers\) issue charm sets that define what chomps will be recommended later. 

Chomps that link together in sequence are stacks. Access and administration of chomps can be organized at the stack level.  

Chomps that don't attract interest would go cold often and might get dropped in favor of more engaging workflows.
