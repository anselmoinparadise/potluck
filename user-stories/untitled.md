# Earning Charms

The increasing speed of industrial and social change makes it difficult to keep up with how the world is working. Many just feel overwhelmed and are resigned to not understanding the machinations of reality, or choose to rely on over simplified or even propagandized stories about why things work the way they do. Even when you are incentivized to learn something, it's hard to track back to the moment of learning, to understand how or why you see something in a particular way.  

Our society can do a lot better than pushing people into traditional, multi-year degree programs and making them compete for professional positions in order to learn how to apply those degrees. Project-based learning offers the possibility of building a culture of community organizing that could be called science-based citizenship.

Potluck offers users the opportunity to organize and prove their talents on the micro level with charms. Charms keep track of the training and chomps you've completed. They mark milestone achievements like knocking a thousand doors. Charms are either claimed or validated with public-facing proof. When someone validates a certain combination of charms, they may combine into Degrees.





With charms, users can value merit and validation of talents
