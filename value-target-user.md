# Value/Target User

#### Target User: Super Volunteers

Super volunteers are non-staff activists who consistently show up to campaign efforts. They lead canvasses, collect the checks at fundraisers and enter donor data in the database. Between campaign seasons they attend city council meetings, march at protests, and file the 20-signature petition with the city to request speed humps on the street. The non-staff activist represents the bulk of growth as our democracy moves toward distributed organizing models.

Lets look at some opportunities to provide value with the super volunteer.

#### Greater Autonomy

Starting an advocacy or electoral campaign on your own is very difficult. In most situations you are forced to choose between doing lots of research about what to do and set up technological and organizational systems your self, or, putting your work under the auspices of an existing campaign or advocacy organization. One could argue this isn't necessarily a problem-- we want people to work together! But as membership in associations of most kinds continue to decline, presenting solutions that offer personal and localized autonomy are valuable.

Potluck provides greater autonomy to the user by making it possible to search for and copy workflows designed for their situation. Instead of sinking costs into a particular party or organization in order to learn or practice their theory of change, the user can explore information in a comprehensive \(and private\) way.

#### Ownership of Data

If one volunteers for a campaign organization in the existing system, the data around your work becomes the property of the campaign organization. For example, if you log onto a caller app hosted by a presidential campaign, you can make hundreds of calls but you are unable to follow up or build those relationships on your own. This affects an alienation of the activist and voter.

Potluck could change this system by permitting users to retain a copy of the input and output data for each chomp, thereby allowing them to retain the content of their contributions, build relationships and ultimately, more distributed power. 

#### Speed/Flexibility to Change

Change models are always changing, and it's important to test and deploy new models quickly. Presidential campaigns, political parties, trade groups and unions have the resources to release new platforms every election cycle, fine tuned to their strategy. But outside of these institutions, it is much harder to adapt, or at least market a new way of doing things. 

On Potluck, a developer could write scripts that further improve or automate a model, and then deploy directly into the marketplace, or push/propose updates to tables under their purview. The super volunteer has more opportunities to collaborate and create value with developers, expanding the culture of open source innovation.
